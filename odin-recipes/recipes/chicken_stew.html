        <h1>Healthy Tumeric Chicken Stew</h1>

        <p>This tumeric chicken stew recipe is one of my favorite 30-minute weeknight recipes. Tumeric (curcumin) is a bright yellow spice primarily found in India and Indonesia.
            It's one of the main ingredients in curry and adds vibrant color and flavor to any dish.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
            <li>2 medium sweet potatoes, cubed</li>
            <li>1/2 medium red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 small eggplant, cubed</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground tumeric</li>
            <li>1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until no longer pink in the center,
                about 5 minutes. Add sweet potatoes and onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggplant, garlic,
                ginger, and tumeric; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Pour in broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally and adding more broth if necessary,
                until vegetables are tender and stew has thickened, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>

        <p>You can use canola oil for olive oil and water for chicken broth if desired.</p>
