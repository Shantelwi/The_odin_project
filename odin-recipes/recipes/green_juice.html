        <h1>Healthy Green Juice</h1>

        <p>This green juice recipe is great for detoxing after the holidays or whenever you have overdone it! It's worth buying organic celery, even if you 
            buy conventional for everything else. Adjust fruit and veggie amounts to suit your personal taste. More apples equals a sweeter drink.
